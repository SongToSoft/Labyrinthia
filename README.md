# Labyrinthia
Unity project with labyrinth generator

Initially, I wanted to make a game out of it, but right now I don’t think it’s a good idea.

# Example labyrinth
![example](https://github.com/TakingAway/Labyrinthia/blob/master/Image/labyrinth.PNG)

This is the one of labyrinth that generate in project. Last line does not have some walls becose, if you try add wall in someplace, you will make isolated zone.
