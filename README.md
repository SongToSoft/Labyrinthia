# Labyrinthia
Unity project with labyrinth generator

Initially, I wanted to make a game out of it, but right now I don’t think it’s a good idea.

This is the one of labyrinth that generate in project. Last line does not have some walls becose, if you try add wall it someplace, you will make isolated zone.
